              <h3> So, Why are data structures important? </h3>
              <br>
              <h4> 1)	Use the right tool for the right problem: </h4>
              <br>

              <p>
                You wouldn’t hammer a screw right? So why would you not learn to use the proper structure
                for a problem? Array’s are awesome structures that provide a host of reason’s to use them,
                but if you have a problem that requires many insertions and deletions, you’d be better off
                using a linked list. Furthermore learning about data structures, you’ll probably come
                across some structures or algorithms you didn’t previously know of, and will add one more
                tool to your toolbox of computing.
              </p><br>

              <h4> 2)	Efficient Problem solving: </h4>
              <br>
              <p>
              Let’s say you’re solving the canonical sorting problem. Let’s say you’re using the selection
              sort, bubble sort, or insertion sort. These algorithms are going to produce quadratic runtime
              (e.g. O(N^2)), while if you only knew what a heap was you could achieve a much better near
              logarithmic runtime (e.g. O(N log(N))). The point being leveraging data structures often produces
              much more efficient algorithms when used properly. Note: if these funky O() functions are confusing
              to you, I will formally introduce them in this article.
            </p> <br>

            <h4> 3)	The job market and the dreaded technical interview:</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
              Most software companies will give you technical interview questions, and the vast majority of companies
              draw from data structures and algorithmic problems when probing candidates for their technical capacities.
              This is a tried and true method for screening candidates because: it illustrates how candidates approach
              a problem, they are language agnostic, and they don’t require you to understand the company’s software stack.
            </p><br>

            <h4> 4)	Knowing and understanding data structures provides you the capacity to write your own
               when the out of the box implementation doesn’t suit the problem: </h4>
            <br>

            <p>
              Let’s say our company has chosen the programing language, “Crazy Academic Functional Lambda Language”,
              to implement an optimized concurrent application for your company’s server architecture. Perhaps this
              language doesn’t have a suitable hash-table implementation for your problem because it rehashes too often
              and is running slow. Well good thing you know data structures because you can implement your own
              hash-table that caters to your needs. I admit this last point is the least likely of the 4 to occur, but
              it is certainly within the realm of possibility.

            <p>
            Before you get started on your way to becoming an efficient developer, there are a few concepts that you may
            or may not have been introduced to that are integral to your understanding of the concepts that I will
            introduce you to in the coming tutorials.
          </p><br>

          <h4>1)	Abstract Data Types (ADT’s)</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            Abstract Data Types were invented by one of our awesome women in computing (not to mention one of the first!)
            Barbara Liskov. An Abstract datatype is:
          </p><br>

          <blockquote>
            <span class="question"> <strong><i><q>
              a mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behavior (semantics)
              from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible
              operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type">as defined by wikipedia</a>
            </q></i></strong></span>
          </blockquote>
          <br>

          <p>
            So let’s unpack this a little: data is defined by behavior, values, and operations independent of
            implementation. Think of a simple list. There are certain operations you will always want to perform
            on lists irrespective of whether the list contains Strings, numbers, objects, or another list. You most
            likely want to be capable of adding and removing items from the list, retrieving items, checking if the
            list contains an item, or checking the size of the list. You know how the list should interact with data
            irrespective of the way the structure is implemented in code, and irrespective of the data itself. A list
            is a list am I right?
          </p><br>

          <p>
            This is why we have ADT’s. This is why we developers can refer to a List, Stack, Queue, Map, Graph, Tree,
            etc. and another developer will know what we are talking about. A Haskell programmer, a C programmer, and
            a python programmer can all have a conversation about these structures without understanding the nuances of
            the specific implementations in one language or another because they all have the same operations, and they
            treat data the same way, irrespective of the data type. In my tutorials the data structures I will be explaining
            will be implemented starting with a java interface, an example of which you can see below where I’m introducing
            parameterized classes.
          </p><br>

          <h4>2)	What is Parameterized programming, or a parameterized class</h4>
          <br>

          <p>
            Parameterized programming is a technique that is used to make your code and classes more portable and reusable.
            When parameterizing our classes we provide generic datatypes to our methods that allow us to implement our data
            structures and algorithms without knowing which datatypes they will operate on. By doing so we don’t have to write
            an algorithm for every type: Integer, Float, String, Object, etc. We use generics and then the programmer using
            the data structure implements the methods for the class upon which their algorithm is operating. For instance
            for lists you need to know if an object T is equal to another object, so the programmer would implement the
            method T equals(T x) where T is the object that fits the desired use case of your class or algorithm. Note if
            you are using java classes the methods have already been implemented for you, but these methods must be implemented
            for a custom class that will be passed to a data structure.
          </p><br>

          <p>To combine these two paradigms let me introduce you to the parameterized List interface:</p><br>

          <div id="codeSnippet">
            <pre>
              <code>
interface List&ltT&gt {
	void add(T x);
	T remove(int i);
	boolean remove(T x);
	T get(int i);
	boolean contains(T x);
	int size();
	default boolean isEmpty() {
		return size() == 0;
	}
}
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>


          <p>
            Here we use the angular brackets to parameterize the list interface so that it may be instantiated with
            many different types, provided they are not primitive data types (e.g. not int float etc.). When you want
            to use primitive data types you must use the wrapper classes of these types (e.g. Integer, Float, Boolean).
          </p><br>

          <h4> 3)	What is Big-O notation and time  and space complexity </h4><br>

          <p>
            Big-O notation is a tool used to compare the efficiency of various algorithms. Big-O  notation is always
            written with N being the input size and O(N) being the output (e.g. the time or space complexity).
						This notation may be used to represent both the time complexity and the space complexity of an algorithm.
            Time complexity is the time it takes the algorithm to execute with respect to the input size, while space complexity
            is the space that must be allocated to execute the algorithm with respect to the input size. Though we can talk about
            best case, average case, and worst case run time. For the purposes of my data structures tutorials, we will most often
            use Big-O to denote the worst case complexity of an algorithm.
						(Algorithm nerds please don’t disown my lack of attention to proper algorithmic analysis!)
          </p><br>

          <h4> The following are the most common big-O complexities </h4>
          <br>

          <figure class="graph text-center">
          <img src="../assets/images/big-o.jpg" id="bigO">
          <p>graph of big-o borrowed from <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com">here</a></p>
        </figure>

				<br><h4> Let's take a look at a few  concrete examples </h4><br>

				<div id="codeSnippet">
					<pre>
						<code>
y = 2 * 5 / 5;
x = 5 - 7 + 2;
System.out.println(Integer.toString(x + y));
				</code >
			</pre>
		</div>
		<br>
		<p>
			In this code snippet we have 3 statements that will run in constant time:
			<br>3 * O(1) -> O(1)<br>
			Now, when we are performing algorithmic analysis we drop constants because
			they generally have a negligable effect on the complexity of the algorithm, so this
			would be an O(1) or constant time algorithm since we drop the 3.
		</p><br>

		<div id="codeSnippet">
			<pre>
				<code>
y = 5 * 10;
for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
	System.out.println(Integer.toString( i * y));
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div><br>

		<p>
			Here we have a single statement followed by a for loop. Any guess on what the runtime will be?
			<br> O(1) + O(N) -> O(N) <br>
			This will be a linear or O(N) algorithm. Notice that the big-O of this algorithm disregards the
			constant time statement at the beggining. When analyzing an algorithm we also disregard lower order
			terms because they will cost disproportionately less time to execute compared to the higher order terms.
		</p><br>

		<div id="codeSnippet">
			<pre>
				<code>
private static boolean retrieve(int [] array, int match, int start, int end) {

	// base case: if pointers are equal or  have overtaken each other
	if(start >= end)
		return array[start] == match;

	int middle = ((end - start) / 2) + start;

	// if they match
	if(array[middle] == match)
		return true;

	// if match is greater than middle element
	else if(match > array[middle])
		return retrieve(array, match, middle + 1, end);

	// if match is less than middle element
	else
		return retrieve(array, match, start, middle);
}
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div><br>

		<p>
			The method above is the recursive helper for a binary search algorithm, which you can find
			<a href="https://github.com/gutscdav000/fun_with_datastructures/blob/master/Tutorials/BinarySearch/src/BinarySearch.java">here</a>.
			As you can see each time the retrieve function is called recursively the parameters passed as start and end divide
			the size of the array being searched by half. This provides us with a time complexity of O(log(N)).
		</p><br>

		<p>
			The next common algorithmic efficiency is O(N * log(N)) or more commonly reffered to as O(NlogN). One of the more
			common algorithms with this runtime efficiency is MergeSort which you may find
			<a href="https://github.com/gutscdav000/fun_with_datastructures/blob/master/Tutorials/MergeSort/src/MergeSort.java">here</a>.
			I'm sorry there isn't quite enough room to fit all of it in this article. In MergeSort we have 3 steps: 1) splitting the
			array which is a constant time operation 2) calling merge sort on the 2 halves of the array recursively 3) merging the 2 sorted halves.
			These 3 steps can be reduced via algorithmic analysis to the following: O(N) + O(Nlog(N)). The O(N) comes from merging the halves of the
			array back together, while the NLog(N) comes from recursively breaking the list into two halves, but the final big-O time complexity of the
			algorithm is O(NLog(N)) because we drop the lower order O(N). Additionally this algorithm has a space complexity of O(N) because a copy of
			the list must be made in order to merge the array back together.
		</p><br>

		<div id="codeSnippet">
			<pre>
				<code>
y = 5 * 10;
for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
	for(int j = 0; j < N; j++)
		System.out.println(Integer.toString(i * j * y));
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div><br>

		<p>
			Can you guess the run time complexity of this algorithm?
		</p>
		<p>
			O(1) + O(N^2) -> O(N^2)
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a quadratic algorithm. Meaning that it will take N * N time to execute the nested for loops. we disregard
			the run time of the first O(1) statement.
